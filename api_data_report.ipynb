    "The reasoning behind my hypothesis of \"Accounts that have more followers also tend to have more posts than accounts with less followers.\" is that people tend to follow people who post more, since then it is easier to keep up with their posts. More popularly followed people such as brands and celebrities also tend to have more followers, and with that also have more things that they post. I think that people who have more followers would have more posts since people are less likely to follow someone who does not post, since then there is not much of a reason to follow the account in order to keep up with them."

    "In order to test this hypothesis statistically, I would like to pull the data of accounts number of followers, as well as the acccounts number of posts. Then I should be able to see (most likely though a graph) that the accounts who tend to have a higher number of posts also have a higher number of followers. If this were to be turned into a graph it would be a positive correlation between followers and posts, meaning the people who post much less also have less followers. The important columns for this would be Account, # of posts, # of followers. "

If an account is too new then it may not have an accurate number for the followers and posts. There may be accounts that are outliers and do not follow my expected pattern for this hypothesis such as bot accounts or spam accounts, who may not have any or many followers but post many posts. If there are deleted posts then its possible that the accounts gained lots of followers from their posting and then once they deleted the posts they retained the followers. These datapoints are fairly ethical to collect, as the number of posts and followers that an account has are typically things you can see even on private accounts. \n"

    "Unfortunately, I ran into a lot of errors in this assignment. This was very challenging for me, and I feel like I end up understanding what we do in class, and then when I need to do it on my own I am able to get somewhere using the old codes I have from class, but then when I get an error I do not know howto resolve it. Steps one and two went fine for me , and I felt confident, and then step three was going okay until my last big section of code only came back with errors. This is where I started getting confused and I feel as though neither my notes or old jupyter notebooks or AI was able to help me clarify this. It could be because I spent a few hours trying to change and fix it so much that I almost got confused with what my original code even was, but this is where this assignment started to go bad for me. Section four I was not really able to complete due to the error messages I was recieving, and I was also not able to do a scatter plot even though I was planning to try one in order to help me visualize the data and see a pattern between my two endpoints and test my hypothesis. Unfortunately I was not able to get the visualizations I wanted for this assignment and get past the \"Error fetching profile for did:plc:rjscsr7qexxigyhnjctym4bk: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://bsky.social/xrpc/app.bsky.actor.getProfile?actor=did%3Aplc%3Arjscsr7qexxigyhnjctym4bk\" error, which led me to not be able to run my code and also not be able to let me get the data points needed. I was also confused since when I was running my code earlier last week in class I was getting some results back with the post count saying none, so I am curious if that was something I would have run into here. I believe that my hypothesis would still be true that the more followers someone has they also have more posts, but unfortunately I do not have a way to prove this. "
